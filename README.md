# concave_optimization
Welcome to the concave_optimization repository.
This repository aims to showcase several global optimizations mostly on concave programming. I took the test of the existing method from paper.
If you use this repo and it works, please don't forget to cite it. If it does not work, please let me know.

## File and its associated paper
Python file falk_hoffman.py
is a numerical simulation of a paper entitled: GLOBAL MINIMIZATION OF A LINEARLY CONSTRAINED CONCAVE FUNCTION BY PARTITION OF FEASIBLE DOMAIN" by J.B.Rosen
The Falk-Hoffman algorithm has been modified. This repository does not guarantee that the flow is the same as in the paper; it is simply testing code.

Python file Tuy_Rosen.py
is a numerical simulation from a paper entitled: Cutting Plane/Tabu Search Algorithms for Low Rank Concave Quadratic Programming Problems
Please examine the code first to the algorithm's steps in the paper. 

## Use it with your own risk
Meaning, double check the code here before you use it.
