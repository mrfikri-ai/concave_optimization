This repository contains a numerical simulation of a paper entitled: GLOBAL MINIMIZATION OF A LINEARLY CONSTRAINED CONCAVE FUNCTION BY PARTITION OF FEASIBLE DOMAIN" by J.B.Rosen

There is a modification on Falk-Hoffman algorithm. Also, this repository does not give any guarantee that the flow is correctly the same as in the paper. Simply just a testing code
